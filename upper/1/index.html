                <h2 class="section-title">Solutions: Detailed Explanations</h2>
                
                <div class="item-container">
                    <p><strong>1. Solution: (Corrected)</strong></p>
                    <div class="concept"><p><strong>Concept:</strong> For a number to be divisible by 88, it must be divisible by its co-prime factors, 8 and 11.
                    <br><strong>Rule for 8:</strong> A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8.
                    <br><strong>Rule for 11:</strong> A number is divisible by 11 if the alternating sum of its digits is a multiple of 11.</p></div>
                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Step 1 (Divisibility by 8):</strong> The number is `472AB8`. The last three digits are `AB8`. A number `100A + 10B + 8` must be divisible by 8. Since `100A` is `96A + 4A` and `10B` is `8B + 2B`, and `96A`, `8B`, `8` are all divisible by 8, the condition simplifies to `4A + 2B` must be divisible by 8. Dividing by 2, we find that <strong>`2A + B` must be a multiple of 4</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Step 2 (Divisibility by 11):</strong> We calculate the alternating sum of the digits of `472AB8`. Start from the right: $(8) - (B) + (A) - (2) + (7) - (4) = A - B + 9$. This sum must be a multiple of 11.
                    </p>
                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Step 3 (Combine Rules and Find A and B):</strong>
                    From Step 2, $A - B + 9$ could be 0, 11, -11, etc.
                    <br>- If $A - B + 9 = 0 \implies B - A = 9$. The only digits that satisfy this are $B=9, A=0$. Let's test this pair with our rule from Step 1: `2A + B = 2(0) + 9 = 9`. Is 9 a multiple of 4? No. This case is invalid.
                    <br>- If $A - B + 9 = 11 \implies A - B = 2$. This is a strong possibility. Let's call this Equation (i).
                    <br>- If $A - B + 9 = 22 \implies A - B = 13$. Impossible for single digits.
                    So we must have <strong>`A - B = 2`</strong>, which means `A = B + 2`.
                    </p>
                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Step 4 (Substitute and Solve):</strong>
                    Now substitute `A = B + 2` into our rule from Step 1 (`2A + B` must be a multiple of 4).
                    <br>`2(B + 2) + B = 4k` (where k is an integer)
                    <br>`2B + 4 + B = 4k`
                    <br>`3B + 4 = 4k`
                    Since 4 is a multiple of 4, for `3B + 4` to be a multiple of 4, `3B` must also be a multiple of 4. As 3 and 4 share no common factors, <strong>B itself must be a multiple of 4</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Step 5 (Check Possible Values for B):</strong>
                    <br>- If B=0, then A = 0 + 2 = 2. Pair: (A,B)=(2,0). $A-B = 2$.
                    <br>- If B=4, then A = 4 + 2 = 6. Pair: (A,B)=(6,4). $A-B = 2$.
                    <br>- If B=8, then A = 8 + 2 = 10. (Not a single digit).
                    Both valid solutions give the same result for A-B.
                    </p>
                    <p class="final-answer">Final Answer: 2</p>

                <div class="item-container">
                    <p><strong>2. Solution:</strong></p>
                    <div class="concept"><p><strong>Concept (Consistent Shortfall & LCM):</strong> When a number leaves remainders that are consistently less than the divisors by the same amount, we can simplify the problem using the Least Common Multiple (LCM).
                    <br>Let N be the number.
                    <br>$N \div 5$ leaves remainder 3 (which is $5-2$).
                    <br>$N \div 7$ leaves remainder 5 (which is $7-2$).
                    <br>$N \div 9$ leaves remainder 7 (which is $9-2$).</p></div>
                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Observe that in each case, the number N is 2 less than a multiple of the divisor. This means that if we add 2 to N, the new number (N+2) will be perfectly divisible by 5, 7, and 9.
                    </p>
                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Step 2:</strong> We need to find a number that is a multiple of 5, 7, and 9. The smallest such positive number is the LCM(5, 7, 9). Since 5, 7, and 9 are co-prime, their LCM is their product: $5 \times 7 \times 9 = 315$.</p>
                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Step 3:</strong> So, $N+2$ must be a multiple of 315. The general form is $N+2 = 315k$ for some integer k. This means $N = 315k - 2$.</p>
                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Step 4:</strong> We are looking for the smallest four-digit number N.
                    <br>- For k=1, $N = 315(1) - 2 = 313$ (3-digit).
                    <br>- For k=2, $N = 315(2) - 2 = 630 - 2 = 628$ (3-digit).
                    <br>- For k=3, $N = 315(3) - 2 = 945 - 2 = 943$ (3-digit).
                    <br>- For k=4, $N = 315(4) - 2 = 1260 - 2 = 1258$ (4-digit).
                    Since this is the first 4-digit number we found, it must be the smallest.</p>

                    <p><strong>3. Solution:</strong></p>
                    <div class="concept"><p><strong>Concept (Cyclicity of Units Digits):</strong> The units digit of powers of a number repeats in a cycle. We only need to look at the units digit of the base.</p></div>
                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Step 1 (For $13^{2023}$):</strong> We only need the units digit of $3^{2023}$.
                    <br>The cycle for powers of 3 is: $3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27 \to 7, 3^4=81 \to 1, 3^5 \to 3$. The cycle is (3, 9, 7, 1) and has a length of 4.
                    <br>To find the position in the cycle, we find the remainder of the exponent when divided by 4: $2023 \div 4 = 505$ R 3. The units digit is the 3rd in the cycle, which is 7.</p>
                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Step 2 (For $17^{2024}$):</strong> We only need the units digit of $7^{2024}$.
                    <br>The cycle for powers of 7 is: $7^1=7, 7^2=49 \to 9, 7^3 \to 3, 7^4 \to 1$. The cycle is (7, 9, 3, 1) and has a length of 4.
                    <br>Find the remainder of the exponent: $2024 \div 4 = 506$ R 0. A remainder of 0 means it's the last digit in the cycle, which is 1.</p>
                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Step 3 (For $19^{2025}$):</strong> We only need the units digit of $9^{2025}$.
                    <br>The cycle for powers of 9 is: $9^1=9, 9^2=81 \to 1$. The cycle is (9, 1).
                    <br>If the exponent is odd, the units digit is 9. If even, it's 1. Since 2025 is odd, the units digit is 9.</p>
                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Step 4 (Sum the units digits):</strong> Add the units digits we found: $7 + 1 + 9 = 17$.</p>
                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Step 5:</strong> The units digit of the sum 17 is 7.</p>

                    <div class="concept"><p><strong>Concept (Divisibility by 9):</strong> A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9.</p></div>
                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Step 1:</strong> The number is `7A52A`. Sum its digits: $7 + A + 5 + 2 + A = 14 + 2A$.</p>
                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Step 2:</strong> The sum, $14 + 2A$, must be a multiple of 9. Let's find the multiples of 9 that are close to 14.
                    <br>- The next multiple of 9 after 14 is 18. Let's set $14 + 2A = 18$.
                    <br>- $2A = 18 - 14 = 4$.
                    <br>- $A = 2$. This is a valid single digit.</p>
                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Let's check the next multiple of 9, which is 27.
                    <br>- Set $14 + 2A = 27$.
                    <br>- $2A = 27 - 14 = 13$.
                    <br>- $A = 6.5$. This is not a digit, so it's not a valid solution.</p>
                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Step 4:</strong> The next multiple of 9, 36, would give an even larger value for A. So, the only possible value for A is 2.</p>

                    <p><strong>5. Solution:</strong></p>
                    <div class="concept"><p><strong>Concept (Modular Arithmetic & Fermat's Little Theorem):</strong> We can find the remainder by looking for a pattern in the remainders of powers. A shortcut is Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, $a^p \equiv a \pmod{p}$. A common corollary is if a is not divisible by p, then $a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$.</p></div>
                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Method 1: Finding a pattern</strong>
                    <br><strong>Step 1:</strong> Find the remainders of powers of 2 when divided by 7:
                    <br>$2^1 \div 7$ leaves remainder 2.
                    <br>$2^2 = 4 \div 7$ leaves remainder 4.
                    <br>$2^3 = 8 \div 7$ leaves remainder 1.
                    <br><strong>Step 2:</strong> We found a cycle. The remainder becomes 1 at $2^3$. This means every group of $2^3$ contributes a remainder of 1.

                    <div class="concept"><p><strong>Concept:</strong> Divisibility by 99 means the number is divisible by 9 and 11.</p></div>
                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Step 1 (Divisibility by 9):</strong> Sum of digits `5+A+8+3+B = 16+A+B` must be a multiple of 9.
                    <br>- The next multiple of 9 after 16 is 18. So, $16+A+B = 18 \implies A+B=2$.
                    <br>- The next is 27. So, $16+A+B = 27 \implies A+B=11$.
                    <br>- The next is 36, making $A+B=20$ (impossible).</p>
                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Step 2 (Divisibility by 11):</strong> Alternating sum of digits `B-3+8-A+5 = B-A+10` must be a multiple of 11.
                    <br>- If $B-A+10=11 \implies B-A=1$.
                    <br>- If $B-A+10=0 \implies B-A=-10$ (impossible).
                    <br>- If $B-A+10=22 \implies B-A=12$ (impossible).
                    So we must have $B-A=1$.</p>
                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Step 3 (Solve the System of Equations):</strong>
                    We have two systems to check:
                    <br>1) $A+B=2$ and $B-A=1$. Adding the two equations gives $2B=3$, so $B=1.5$ (not a digit). This case is invalid.
                    <br>2) $A+B=11$ and $B-A=1$. Adding the two equations gives $2B=12$, so $B=6$. If $B=6$, then $A=5$. This is a valid solution.</p>
                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Step 4:</strong> The question asks for the value of $B-A$. From our valid solution, $B-A = 6-5 = 1$.</p>

                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Step 1:</strong> The number consists of the digit 7 repeated 2023 times.</p>
                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Find the sum of its digits. The sum is $7 \times 2023$.</p>
                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Step 3:</strong> We need to find the remainder of this sum when divided by 9. We can use modular arithmetic.
                    <br>Remainder of 7 when divided by 9 is 7 (or -2).
                    <br>Remainder of 2023 when divided by 9: Sum of digits of 2023 is $2+0+2+3=7$. So the remainder of 2023 is 7.

                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Step 4:</strong> The remainder of the product is the product of the remainders.

                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Step 1:</strong> We need the units digit of $7^{(\text{some large number})}$. The cycle of units digits for powers of 7 is (7, 9, 3, 1), which has a length of 4.
                    <br>The units digit is determined by the remainder of the exponent when divided by 4.</p>
                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Step 2:</strong> The exponent is $7^7$. We need to find the remainder of $7^7$ when divided by 4.
                    <br>Let's look at powers of 7 modulo 4.
                    <br>$7 \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$ or $7 \equiv -1 \pmod{4}$. Using -1 is easier.
                    <br>$7^7 \equiv (-1)^7 \pmod{4}$.
                    <br>$(-1)^7 = -1$.
                    <br>So, $7^7 \equiv -1 \pmod{4}$, which is the same as a remainder of 3.

                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Step 3:</strong> The remainder of the exponent ($7^7$) when divided by 4 is 3. This means we need the 3rd digit in the cycle of 7s.</p>

                    <div class="concept"><p><strong>Concept:</strong> Divisibility by 72 means divisible by 8 and 9.</p></div>
                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Step 1 (Divisibility by 8):</strong> The last three digits, `A3B`, must form a number divisible by 8. We can test values.
                    <br>Let's consider `A30`. $8 \times 16 = 128$, $8 \times 29=232$, $8 \times 41=328$, $8 \times 54=432$, etc.
                    <br>Let's list the possibilities for `A3B`:
                    <br>- If A=0, `032`=32 works. B=2.
                    <br>- If A=1, `136` works. B=6.
                    <br>- If A=2, `232` works. B=2.
                    <br>- If A=3, `336` works. B=6.
                    ...and so on. The pattern for B is (2, 6, 2, 6, ...). If A is even, B=2. If A is odd, B=6.</p>
                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Step 2 (Divisibility by 9):</strong> Sum of digits `8+7+6+5+A+3+B = 29+A+B` must be a multiple of 9.
                    <br>- If $29+A+B=36 \implies A+B=7$.
                    <br>- If $29+A+B=45 \implies A+B=16$.
                    </p>
                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Step 3 (Combine Rules and Test Cases):</strong>
                    <br>- <strong>Case 1: A+B = 7.</strong>
                    <br>  - If A is even, B must be 2. Then $A+2=7 \implies A=5$. But A must be even, so this is a contradiction.
                    <br>  - If A is odd, B must be 6. Then $A+6=7 \implies A=1$. A=1 is odd. This works! So (A,B)=(1,6) is a solution.
                    <br>- <strong>Case 2: A+B = 16.</strong>
                    <br>  - If A is even, B must be 2. Then $A+2=16 \implies A=14$. Not a digit.
                    <br>  - If A is odd, B must be 6. Then $A+6=16 \implies A=10$. Not a digit.
                    The only valid solution is (A,B) = (1,6).

                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Step 4:</strong> The question asks for $2A+B$. Using our solution (1,6):
                    $2(1) + 6 = 2 + 6 = 8$.</p>
