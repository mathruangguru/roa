                <h2 class="section-title">Solutions: Detailed Explanations</h2>
                
                <div class="item-container">
                    <p><strong>1. Solution: (Corrected)</strong></p>
                    <div class="concept"><p><strong>Concept:</strong> For a number to be divisible by 88, it must be divisible by its prime factors, 8 and 11.
                    <br><strong>Rule for 8:</strong> A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8. A more advanced trick is that for a 3-digit number $H T U$, it's divisible by 8 if $4H + 2T + U$ is divisible by 8.
                    <br><strong>Rule for 11:</strong> A number is divisible by 11 if the alternating sum of its digits is a multiple of 11.</p></div>
                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Step 1 (Divisibility by 8):</strong> The number is $472AB8$. The last three digits are $AB8$. Let's use the advanced rule: $4A + 2B + 8$ must be divisible by 8. Since 8 is divisible by 8, we can simplify this to: $4A + 2B$ must be divisible by 8. Dividing by 2, we find that <strong>$2A + B$ must be a multiple of 4</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Step 2 (Divisibility by 11):</strong> We calculate the alternating sum of the digits of $472AB8$. Start from the right: $(8) - (B) + (A) - (2) + (7) - (4) = A - B + 9$. This sum must be a multiple of 11.
                    </p>
                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Step 3 (Combine Rules and Find A and B):</strong>
                    From Step 2, $A - B + 9$ could be 0, 11, -11, etc.
                    <br>- If $A - B + 9 = 0 \implies B - A = 9$. The only digits that satisfy this are $B=9, A=0$. Let's test this pair with our rule from Step 1: $2A + B = 2(0) + 9 = 9$. Is 9 a multiple of 4? No. So this case is invalid.
                    <br>- If $A - B + 9 = 11 \implies A - B = 2$. This is a strong possibility. Let's call this Equation (i).
                    <br>- If $A - B + 9 = 22 \implies A - B = 13$. Impossible for single digits.
                    <br>- If $A - B + 9 = -11 \implies A - B = -20$. Impossible.
                    So we must have <strong>$A - B = 2$</strong>, which means $A = B + 2$.
                    </p>
                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Step 4 (Substitute and Solve):</strong>
                    Now we substitute $A = B + 2$ into our rule from Step 1 ($2A + B$ must be a multiple of 4).
                    <br>$2(B + 2) + B = 4k$ (where k is an integer)
                    <br>$2B + 4 + B = 4k$
                    <br>$3B + 4 = 4k$
                    Since 4 is a multiple of 4, for $3B + 4$ to be a multiple of 4, $3B$ must also be a multiple of 4. As 3 and 4 share no common factors, <strong>B itself must be a multiple of 4</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Step 5 (Check Possible Values for B):</strong>
                    <br>- If B=0, then A = 0 + 2 = 2. Pair: (A,B)=(2,0). $A-B = 2$.
                    <br>- If B=4, then A = 4 + 2 = 6. Pair: (A,B)=(6,4). $A-B = 2$.
                    <br>- If B=8, then A = 8 + 2 = 10. (Not a single digit).
                    Both valid solutions give the same result.
                    </p>

                <div class="item-container">
                    <p><strong>2. Solution:</strong></p>
                    <div class="concept"><p><strong>Concept (Consistent Shortfall & LCM):</strong> When a number leaves remainders that are consistently less than the divisors by the same amount, we can simplify the problem using the Least Common Multiple (LCM).
                    <br>Let N be the number.
                    <br>$N \div 5$ leaves remainder 3. This is 2 less than 5.
                    <br>$N \div 7$ leaves remainder 5. This is 2 less than 7.
                    <br>$N \div 9$ leaves remainder 7. This is 2 less than 9.</p></div>
                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Observe that in each case, the number N is 2 less than a multiple of the divisor. This means that if we add 2 to N, the new number (N+2) will be perfectly divisible by 5, 7, and 9.
                    </p>
                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Step 2:</strong> We need to find a number that is a multiple of 5, 7, and 9. The smallest such positive number is the Least Common Multiple, LCM(5, 7, 9). Since 5, 7, and 9 share no common factors, their LCM is their product: $5 \times 7 \times 9 = 315$.</p>
                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Step 3:</strong> So, $N+2$ must be a multiple of 315. This means $N+2$ could be 315, 630, 945, 1260, 1575, and so on.</p>
                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Step 4:</strong> We are looking for the smallest four-digit number N. We can find the corresponding N for each multiple:
                    <br>- If $N+2 = 945$, then $N = 945 - 2 = 943$ (This is a 3-digit number).
                    <br>- If $N+2 = 1260$, then $N = 1260 - 2 = 1258$ (This is a 4-digit number).
                    Since this is the first 4-digit number we found, it must be the smallest.</p>
                    <p class="final-answer">Final Answer: 1258</p>

                <div class="item-container">
                    <p><strong>6. Solution:</strong></p>
                    <div class="concept"><p><strong>Concept (Divisibility by 8):</strong> A number is divisible by 8 if the number formed by its last three digits is divisible by 8.</p></div>
                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Step 1:</strong> The number is $1234x$. The last three digits form the number $34x$. We need to find a digit $x$ (from 0 to 9) such that $34x$ is divisible by 8.</p>
                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Let's test values. We can start by dividing 340 by 8.
                    <br>$340 ÷ 8 = 42$ with a remainder of 4.
                    <br>This means $340$ is 4 less than a multiple of 8. To make it a multiple of 8, we need to add 4. So, the number must be $340 + 4 = 344$.</p>
                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Step 3:</strong> If the number is 344, then x = 4. Let's check if there are any other possibilities. The next multiple of 8 would be $344 + 8 = 352$. In this case, x would be 2, but the tens digit would be 5, not 4. So, $352$ is not of the form $34x$.</p>
                    <p class="solution-p"><strong>Step 4:</strong> Therefore, the only possible value for x is 4. The question asks for the value of $x$, not the sum of values.</p>
